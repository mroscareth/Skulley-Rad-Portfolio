THE SKULLEY RAD NARRATIVE
================================================================================

"Skulley Rad, The Last Designer of Humankind" is a satirical character and creative narrative layer for this portfolio. The concept imagines a future where AI has made human creativity automatic, and Skulley Rad represents the last graphic designer before this transition.

The character exists in a "digital mausoleum" - an interactive 3D space where visitors can explore his work and memories. This is Oscar's way of commenting on AI's impact on creative industries while showcasing his actual professional portfolio.

IMPORTANT: While the narrative is satirical, the portfolio and work showcased are entirely real and represent Oscar Moctezuma Rodriguez's actual professional capabilities.
